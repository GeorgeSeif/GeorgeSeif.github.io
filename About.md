Hi, I'm George. Nice to meet you!

This is my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts and things that I find interesting.

Work-wise, I currently work at Atlassian building AI-powered products. I've been in the field of AI since the beginning of my career. 

Life-wise I love learning new things, reading books, and travelling (especially for safaris!).

If any of this resonates, feel free to DM me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgeseif/)
