_[Get to the Point!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34057051-get-to-the-point)_ by Joel Schwartzberg is the best book I've ever read on communicating ideas effectively. True to the title, it's short (128 small pages, a mere 2 hour audiobook) but direct in explaining the practical communication techniques. 

My notes from the book (but you should read the whole thing!):

## Know and heavily emphasize your point
- Ensure that you 100% understand the specific point you want to communicate. You must be able to defend it clearly and concisely
- It’s OK if you repeat your point multiple times. Emphasis on key ideas is a good thing
- Focus each sentence on conveying a single, clear main point. Ensure your message is unambiguous, leaving no room for misinterpretation

## Communicate thoughtfully
- Consider who the audience is. What do they want to know? What is truly valuable to them? What presentation format and style fits them best?
- It takes twice as long to understand something than it does to say it. Therefore, pauses are important both for your audience to process / understand your point and for emphasizing its importance
- It’s best to speak slowly so that the audience can fully understand. Projecting your voice helps with this since it takes more energy to talk so you naturally slow down
- Use body language to add to the clarity. The body language should be confident and fit the message

## Use your words effectively
- Avoid using vague adjectives like "excellent," "fantastic," "terrific," or "very good." Use specific wording like “efficient”, high return on investment, resilient
- Keep your words as few as possible. The more words, the more noise
- Avoid crutch words like “um”, “so”, "you know". They’re useless and don’t add anything
- Your point must have a singular focus. Avoid things like “it will make us efficient and more resilient”. Stick to one main idea and drive it home
- Make sure that by the end of your speech, your audience fully understands your point and the value it has to them
